Experimental Design:
- Generate a fen 10 or 20 moves from the end of the game
- See which side has the advantage from analysis of board configuration by chess engine
- Run simulations with 10000 games.
- Run this 50 times
- Plot on Excel graph
- If the win and lose lines are interwoven, do more trials
