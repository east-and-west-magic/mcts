======

This may or may not work, unlike the look-ahead.

Depends on the length of the simulation, run follow-up simulations.
This generalize the look-ahead idea below.


DONE:
======
Do not try other options if there is a win/checkmate. This will speed things up.

Good result: !!
44k/1m, 20min / 7hours, no converge.
Aha, after this change, it converge in less than 2min.
